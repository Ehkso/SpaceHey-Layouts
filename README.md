# SpaceHey-Layouts
Decided to make a repo to store the layouts I make for SpaceHey, a MySpace clone.\
Will update whenever I remember that SpaceHey exists, and then also remember that I'm keeping a collection here.

Usage: Copy-paste the code into the 'About Me' section of your profile on SpaceHey.\
Note that this requires a SpaceHey account and is intended to be used on SpaceHey - don't expect it to be perfectly usable for making websites.

Also check out my profile on SpaceHey at spacehey.com/aeio where I should (eventually) upload the layouts I make so that you can see it there too :p
